 Rebuiling the program:
 
    1. Ensure you have Visual Studio with C# and .NET 4.8 options are installed
    2. Run 'build.bat' (which should work out-of-the-box) in most cases
    3. If not, read the messages from msbuild.
    4. If all else fails, open the solution file in your Visual Studio IDE en build it manually
