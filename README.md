# Terminal2 - v1.3.2.4
## Builds with Visual Studio 2022 (Community or Professional). No extras needed.

Terminal emulator for Engineers (with Serial and TCP socket capabilities)

## Sales pitch
Every Embedded Engineer needs a Terminal Emulator at some point in their career.
Terminal2 combines features of a number of terminal emulators out there.  

With Terminal2, you can define colorful profiles and quickly switch between sessions (profiles).  You can share profiles with colleagues. You can create and assign multi-line macros to function keys and you can change the color of the incoming text based of keywords you define.

## Goals
1. Be reliable
2. Easy to use
3. Easy to maintain
4. Useful

## Keywords
Terminal Emulator, Baud rate, Parity, Stop bits, Handshaking, TCP Client, TCP Server, ASCII, HEX, Line feed, Carriage return, Log files, Profiles, Fonts, Macros

## Building Terminal2
1. Windows 10, 11 with .NET 4.7.2 or later
2. Visual Studio (2019 or later) with C#.
3. Load the solution (.sln file).
4. Build (Debug or Release).
5. Add Terminal2.exe to your start menu or toolbar.

## Terminal2
The font face has been kept clean and the settings have been moved one layer down.

Here is a real example where I configured a U-Blox WiFi device

### The name
The name "Terminal2" was chosen to allow existing users of the very useful (now unmaintained) "Terminal" program to adapt quickly.
It will definitely change some time in the future.

## Feedback
Constructive feedback very welcome.
