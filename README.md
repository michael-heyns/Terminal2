## Terminal2
The font face has been kept clean and the settings have been moved one layer down.

Here is an example from Scotty's emulator on Enterprise (NCC-1701-B)

### The name
The name "Terminal2" was chosen to allow existing users of the very useful (but unmaintained) "Terminal" program (by Br@dy++) to adapt quickly.
It will definitely change some time in the future.

Constructive feedback welcome.
